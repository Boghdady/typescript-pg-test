=> Challenge 2: BACKEND
   ===================

1- Install Postgres (v11 preferably) & nodejs 12 (describe what you needed to do to have these versions)

=> solution-1 =>   "Use NVM, stand for node version manager for node and change my current node version to 12 and setup postgres v11 on my local machine" (Not the best solution)

=> solution-2=> "Use docker" (Good solution, and i will use it)

- Usage :
1- docker build -t typescript-pg-test .
2- docker-compose up --build

 ===================================================================================================================

 (Usecase 1) =>  Improve the database calls to allow the program to be run any number of times (without complaining that the table already exists) (what would be a more permanent solution to this?);

=> solution => If table exists drop table then create it, if it does not exist just create it so i add this statement "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS github_users;"
That statement drops the table if it exists but will not throw an error if it does not
