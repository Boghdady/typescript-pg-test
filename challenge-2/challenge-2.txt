=> Challenge 2: BACKEND
   ===================

1- Install Postgres (v11 preferably) & nodejs 12 (describe what you needed to do to have these versions)

=> solution-1 =>   "Use NVM, stand for node version manager for node and change my current node version to 12 and setup postgres v11 on my local machine" (Not the best solution)

=> solution-2=> "Use docker" (Good solution, and i will use it)
- Usage :
1- docker build -t typescript-pg-test .
2- docker-compose up --build
